Your job is to return the middle character of the word. 
If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. 
If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.


```
function getMiddle(s){ 
          if (s.length%2==0) {
              let x = s.length/2-1;
              return(s.substr(x, 2)); 
            }
            else {
              let x=Math.floor((s.length/2))
